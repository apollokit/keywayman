- add a UI
- add automatic reloading of keystroke yaml whenever the file changes
- figure out better handling for sticky keys (maybe turn sticky keys off before executing a keystroke sequence?)
- add recording of keystroke sequence
- build appropriate delays into the code (maybe always add one after a keystroke with a modifier key?)
- investigate if there is a better way to handle modifier keys than just inserting delays
- add slow playback mode with display of current keystroke being executed
